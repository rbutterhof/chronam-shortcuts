Documenting shortcuts for ChronAm Search

##Searching in a particular title
Limiting your search to a particular title is a pain if you use the the title text facet. You can limit a search to a particular title by finding the titles LCCN/unique ID. On the loc.gov site, the LCCN is the number after https://www.loc.gov/resource/[LCCN] or loc.gov/item/[LCCN].  Newspaper LCCNS often start with "sn" but they can also start with a year, like "2025"

One you have the LCCN for a title, you can limit that search with &fa=number_lccn:

In this example, I'm searching the pages of the Detroit Evening Times for the word "rations".
